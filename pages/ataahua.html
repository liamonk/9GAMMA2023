      <h2> History of Meatballs: <h2>
      <p>
  
  Believe it or not, the meatballs we know and love today didn’t originate in Italy. In fact, if you travel to Italy and stop by an authentic restaurant, it will be hard to find spaghetti and meatballs on the menu.
  
  So, if it didn’t originate in Italy, where did spaghetti and meatballs originate from? Unfortunately, we don’t know the exact origins of spaghetti and meatballs as a dish or exactly who invented meatballs in the first place. Even though the history of meatballs is largely unknown, this fan-favorite is believed to have originated from kofta, a Persian dish containing a mixture of meats and either rice, bulger or mashed lentils. Over time, this dish eventually spread to other countries and cultures.
  
  Once it reached Italy, the people there created their own version called polpette. Polpette contains meats ranging from beef to veal as well as ingredients like eggs, garlic, parsley and cheese. This simple food was mixed and then formed into small balls — sometimes even marble-sized. The meatballs were then consumed as a main course or with a light soup broth. </p>

        <li> They're very affordable to make and eat </li>
        <li> They're simple and diverse
        <li> They're quick and easy to make </li>
        <li> They have a lot of protein in them, as well as a lot of iron. If made into spaghetti and meatballs, you also get the health benefits from the pasta and sauce too. The pasta contains energy-producing carbs, and the sauce has lycopene, all of which combine together to make a healthy trifecta dish. </li>
