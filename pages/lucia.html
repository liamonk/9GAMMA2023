     <h2>The History of NYC Pizza
     </h2> 
     <p> NYC pizza History. New York-style pizza began with the opening of America's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, by Gennaro Lombardi in the Little Italy neighborhood of Manhattan in 1905, which served large, wide pies. An employee, Antonio Totonno Pero, cooked the pizzas and slices were sold for 5Â¢.
