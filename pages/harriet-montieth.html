           <h2>History of Brownies </h2>
           <p>Brownies came into being because socialite and philanthropist Bertha Palmer was head of the Board of Lady Managers for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. She directed Palmer House pastry chefs to come up with a recipe for a dessert that would be easy to transport in boxed lunches at the Women's Pavilion.</p>
